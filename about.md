From September of third year every Computer Applications student in Dublin City University pairs up and picks a project of their liking to implement until the start of March. 

We have picked the area of network storage, essentially trying to create our own "Google Drive". 

Distributed Cloud Storage, written in Go, is a set of programs for creating your own storage servers and accessing them through convenient clients. Take control of your data!
