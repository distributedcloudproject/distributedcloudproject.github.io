Welcome to our first blog post! Here we will discuss our progress, software engineering process, major decisions, and design considerations.

Look at this epic Go code:

{% highlight go %}
func print_hi(name string) {
    fmt.Printf("Hi, %s", name)
}

print_hi("Tom") // -> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
