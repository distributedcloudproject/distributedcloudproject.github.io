This is our second blog post in the series. Client GUI is a big one.

About half-way there. Time pressure is picking up.

Design - chunk distribution. Client. Website with HTTP API.

Project management - meetings.

CI/CD - deployment on servers. Ansible.

Testing - tested on actual GCP servers. Will also verbally validate with potential users.

Next, final components and docs. Submitting the project.
